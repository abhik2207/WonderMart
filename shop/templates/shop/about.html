              <p><i>WonderMart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in New Delhi, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products. The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2017, WonderMart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. WonderMart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. In August 2018, American retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in WonderMart for US$16 billion, valuing WonderMart at around US$20 billion. WonderMart is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022. It is planning to go public through a listing in the United States of India in 2023.</i></p>
